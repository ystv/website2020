# Internal
This is where any member of YSTV will be able to YSTV related activites with ease!
## Homepage
* Depending on users groups will display links to the items.
* Announcements by the officers.

* Quick links to our Slack, FB, Twitter, Insta.

## Webcams
* We will clamp down on the security of the webcams so a user will need to be logged in to view them.
* Public current viewcount

## Upload
* Not to be confused with the `upload` subdomain (that is used for 3rd parties to send us files)
* Users can upload their video quickly where we will upload to our other media sites automatically
* Users can upload the file with or without barely any metadata so it will be quicker for that person to upload and then it can be managed by someone else i.e. presentation officer as a final okay.
* Supports thumbnails, tags, description as metadata.
## Video Management
* Upload but more powerful
* Users can see uploaded videos
  * Assign them to a certain videobox
  * Add missing data
  * See progression of encode
  * See statistics for that video
  * Manage comments posted
* Manage videoboxes
  * Groups videos into series
  * Can be made recursively, whilst videos are not. e.g. We have the Hunted series (videobox), we have the first season (videobox) and the third episode (video).
  * Choose whether it is public facing or is it YSTV internal. (So if it is guide / inappropriate for public release)
  * See total stats for all videos inside of the video box
## Internal videos
A YSTV member resource
* Tutorial videos on how to use things
